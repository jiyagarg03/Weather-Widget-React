# React Weather Widget

A simple and responsive weather widget built using React.

I previously created a similar weather widget without using React. This version is built with React to demonstrate a modular, component-based structure and enhanced state management.

## Features

- Search weather by city name
- Fetches real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Displays temperature, weather condition, and location
- Simple and responsive UI

## Built With

- React
- OpenWeatherMap API
