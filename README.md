# Weather Widget (React)

A minimal and responsive weather widget built using React, Vite, and Material UI.  
It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a clean, styled UI.

This is a React version of a previous weather widget I built without React â€” rebuilt for better modularity, performance, and maintainability.
